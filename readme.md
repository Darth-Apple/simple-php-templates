# Dirt-Simple PHP Templates

This is an extremely lightweight template engine that allows your applicationâ€™s HTML to be fully decoupled from your PHP. This template engine runs at near-native speeds thanks to its built-in compiler, making it much faster than similar interpreted template engines. Almost no performance overhead is present on a properly cached setup.
